<h2>Figma Designs</h2>

<div className='figma-para'>

<p>I have loved having a UI/UX class in this course. Unfortunately it was only for one semester, and I will certainly miss it moving forward in the Software Development program. </p>

<br/>

<p>But I do feel I took full advantage of this class and tried to learn and soak up everything that I could.  </p>

<br/>

<p>I like seeing the tiny details among the big picture. How simply changing the opacity in a button can change the look and feel of the entire page.</p>

<br/>

<p>There is something special about creating something for someone and seeing how fulfilled they are by it. They know there is a future beyond the design. I want to put their perspective into reality and make it happen for them. </p>

<br/>

<p>This is why I love design, and I love being able to write code to bring it to life.</p>
